   hat hacker hacks under good intentions with permission, and a black hat hacker, most often unauthorized
   , has malicious intent, there is a third kind known as a grey hat hacker who hacks with good intentions
    but at times without permission.their are 3 types of hackers.The role of etchical hacker is to hack into
systems with permissions and to check the security of Programs.
An ethical hacker operates with the knowledge and permission of the organization for which they are trying to defend. In some cases,
 the organization will neglect to inform their information security team of the activities that will be carried
  out by an ethical hacker in an attempt to test the effectiveness of the information security team. This is referred 
  to as a double-blind environment. In order to operate effectively and legally, an ethical hacker must be informed of
   the assets that should be protected, potential threat sources, and the extent to which the organization will support
    an ethical hacker's efforts.</p>
